## What is it
Its just a custom version of layered architecture, fine-tuned for flutter apps, aming for high `testability` and `simplicity`.

## Overview
This architecture consists of 4 main layers, where each layer reside in its own package:
### 1. Domain
>**Responsible for defining app language**

In short, any class or interface that both UI and Data layer should be aware of, in order to communicate with each other.
Examples are Models/Entities, base classes, repository interfaces.
#### Rules
- Do not depend on any layer.
- No UI code allowed in this layer.
- No data code allowed in this layer.
- No dependency to `Flutter`.
- No implementation of its own interfaces.

##
### 2. UI
>**Responsible for showing app data**

This layer is responsible for defining all widgets that is visible to user. From template to small ones.
It also can use state management tools for managing state of a `UI` unit. It's important to note that here we should not define state managers that are general purpose, like AuthCubit. because this way we're crossing layer responsibility.
#### Rules
- Only depends on domain layer
- No Data code allowed in this layer.
- No domain code allowed in this layer.
- No navigation code allowed

##
### 3. Data
>**Responsible for Providing app data**

Defines any class that is evolved in process of fetching raw data till translating it to domain language.
So it may contain data sources, repositories and any other class that helps to produce domain language.
For example `AuthCubit` will live in this layer, because its an implementation of `AuthIO` in domain. It helps to provide something that translate data to domain requirements.

#### Rules
- Only depends on domain layer
- No UI code allowed in this layer.
- No domain code allowed in this layer.

##
### 4. App
>**Responsible for connecting layers**

Data and UI layers are nothing useful by themselves, so another layer step in to connect them together.
App layer is our final package where we instantiate both UI and data classes, and pass instances to eachother as their constructor requirement. This package will define routes and pages of the client app, so it is the only one aware of navigation system.
It can also define app themes, env variables, flavors, feature flags and anything related to app in general.
#### Rules
- Depends on all UI and data and domain layer.
- No UI code allowed in this layer.
- No domain code allowed in this layer.
- No Data code allowed in this layer.


## Why package-by-leyer?
While it may seem unpopular choice among micro service folks, this is a huge step into separating concerns and prevent spaghetti code in big projects.
Here we are not suggesting having `all` of our codebase separated by layer-first approach. Because we are assuming that we already extracted any feature that could be extracted and be reused in other apps, like trade and auth, into separate package, and we are only architecting whatever is remained.
Cause if you think about it, there are lot of things in any app that is not reusable for other apps. Examples are home and profile.
If you separate you app into layers first, developers can easily understand your whole app architecture in a glance, without trying to open each feature folder to make sure they are following exact same layers. also, you are promoting TDD principles with this layering, as you have strict line between your UI and data code. Usually in TDD, you write your UI without worrying about whom provide you data and how. with this separation by package, there is `zero` chance for any developer to violate this rule, because if you ever for example try to fetch data directly in UI code, you will get `compile time` error, thanks to dart dependency management which tells there's is no dependency between UI package and data package.
Also keep in mind that in each package, we don't blindly throw classes in a single folder. We still foldering them by meaningful topics, so it won't be confusing or hard to find what you are looking for.

## Problems that this architecture solves
in a survey from deriv mobile developers, we asked them to list problems in the codebase they work on daily. Here are top 3:
- Hard Debugging
 - Due to tight coupling
- Hard Testing
 - Due to bad/no dependency injection
- Hard Modifying
 - Due to tight coupling.

Tight coupling is result of mixing UI and data code, which in this architecture we tried to define clear constraints for violating it, by having separate package for each layer.
Also missing domain layer is the real cause of having bad dependency injection and low testability.

## Problems that this architecture introduces
- You high level widgets, like templates and layouts, will probably have long list of dependencies in their constructor, as they need to also provide dependency for their children. We can fix that by passing them `.of(context)` way but personally i prefer get compile error when i miss passing a dependency, not runtime one.
- You need to go through 1-2 more folder to add/remove a features compared to feature-first architects.
- You might not be familiar with TDD and fail to define proper interfaces for your UI.(happens for me)

## Folders Structure
First we create the main `app` package. then we create a folder called `packages` and put other 3 package in there(`UI`, `data`, `domain`).
You can find a sample of this structure in `example` folder of this repo.


    app-package
    │
    ├── packages
    │   ├── data-package   
    │   ├── ui-package
    │   └── domain-package

## Localization
should be done in `UI package`, since only widgets in UI package need localization.
We can do it by passing generated localization delegates from `UI package` to `app package` in `MaterialApp`, and thats no issue because our app package already knows about UI package.
